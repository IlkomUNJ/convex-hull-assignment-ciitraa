# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  

I'm using Gemini AI. I usually use the prompt "how to (what I want to know)" to have Gemini explain it step by step. In this assignment, I've provided the prompt "How to create a convex hull in CPP with Qt Creator" and Gemini AI shows me step by step. if i get confused, i will ask the AI again, like "where is the wigdet box?" or "how do i change the button name?" Then, when there's an error or bug in the code and I can't figure it out, I'll ask "why it's happening and how to fix it." But sometimes AI can be wrong, either because I'm using it incorrectly or because the AI ​​isn't capable enough to handle the problem. So we can't completely rely on AI.

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 

In completing this assignment, I was assisted by several of my friends. Starting from the beginning, my Qt Creator error could not be opened, assisted by Darren as the PJ who explained it in the class group. Then when I wanted to run but the button could not be pressed because something had not been downloaded, Ryan helped me resolve it. Then help also came from several of my friends, namely Darrell, Cintia, Lala, Dijah, Nadia, Naila, and Amel who helped me understand the concept of the convex hull and provided input and suggestions for the assignment.
